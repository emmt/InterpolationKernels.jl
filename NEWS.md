## Version 0.2.0

* Kernel type constructors should be type-stable.

* The `values` method can be applied to an interpolation kernel to retrieve its
  parameters.

* Possible floating-point types are limited to the concrete types in the union
  `InterpolationKernels.Floats` which contains `Float16`, `Float32`, `Float64`,
  and `BigFloat`.

* The `summary` method now (correctly) prints the type of a kernel and takes an
  instance of `IO` as first parameter.  The floating-point type is part of the
  textual representation written by the `show` method.

* Method `getweights` renamed as `compute_weights` and no longer exported.  New
  method `compute_offset_and_weights` that eventually calls `compute_weights`
  to compute the interpolation weights in a carefully optimized way.

* Tests are done with reference implementations of the kernel functions.

* Boundary conditions are no longer part of the type definition of an
  interpolation kernel and the hierarchy of kernel types has been modified.
  The most visible changes are summarized by the following table (the same
  rules apply for the types implementing the derivatives and whose names are
  suffixed by `...Prime`):

  | `LanczosKernel{T,S}()`            | `LanczosKernel{S,T}()`            | Lanczos resampling kernel                                   |
  | `KeysSpline{T}(a)`                | `CardinalCubicSpline{T}(a)`       | Keys family of cardinal cubic splines                       |
  | `CardinalCubicSpline{T}(c)`       | `CardinalCubicSpline{T}((c-1)/2)` | cardinal cubic splines defined by a *tension* parameter `c` |
  | `CatmullRomSpline{T}()`           | `CatmullRomSpline{T}()`           | Catmull & Rom cardinal cubic spline                         |
  | `MitchellNetravaliSpline{T}(b,c)` | `MitchellNetravaliSpline{T}(b,c)` | Mitchell & Netravali family of cubic splines                |

* The order of type parameters for Lanczos resampling kernels have been
  exchanged.  This is to be more consistent with B-splines types and to have
  the size parameter `S` playing a more prominent role than the floating-point
  type parameter `T` which defaults to `Float64` and can thus be omitted.

* `RectangularSpline`, `LinearSpline`, `QuadraticSpline` and `CubicSpline` (and
  their derivatives `RectangularSplinePrime`, `LinearSplinePrime`,
  `QuadraticSplinePrime` and `CubicSplinePrime`) have been replaced by
  `BSpline{S}` (and its derivative `BSplinePrime{S}`) with `S` the **order** of
  the B-spline: `S = 1` for a **rectangular B-spline**, `S = 2` for a **linear
  B-spline**, `S = 3` for a **quadratic B-spline**, and `S = 4` for a **cubic
  B-spline**.

* `CubicSpline` (and derivative `CubicSplinePrime`) is a now a new generic
  cubic spline which is CÂ¹ continuous and parameterized by `a = ker'(1)` and `b
  = ker(1)` the slope and value of the function `ker(x)` at `x = 1` with `ker`
  the `CubicSpline` instance.  This new kernel type is better optimized than
  the former Mitchell & Netravali kernels.

* Mitchell & Netravali kernels built by `MitchellNetravaliSpline` are now
  emulated by instances of `CubicSpline` and benefit from a speed up by a
  factor of about 1.5 thanks to this new family of kernels.  Computing the
  interpolation offset and weights now takes 18 operations (14 for the
  derivative) instead of 28 operations (20 for the derivative) in the former
  implementation.

* There is only one generic family of cardinal cubic splines implemented by
  type `CardinalCubicSpline` (and derivative `CardinalCubicSplinePrime`).  This
  family is parameterized by the slope `a = ker'(1)` the function `ker(x)` at
  `x = 1` with `ker = CardinalCubicSpline(a)` as were Keys' cardinal cubic
  splines in the previous version of the package (formely `KeysSpline` and
  `KeysSplinePrime`).  In the versions 0.1.x of the package,
  `CardinalCubicSpline` were cardinal cubic splines parameterized by the
  so-called *tension* defined by `c = 2*ker'(1) + 1`.  These splines can be
  emulated by the new cardinal cubic splines with parameter `a = (c - 1)/2`.
